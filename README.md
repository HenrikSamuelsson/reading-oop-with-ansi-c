# Reading OOP with ANSI-C

Material related to reading the book Object-Oriented Programming with ANSI-C by Axel Schreiner.

## Book Info

This is a little bit older book published around 1993. Description on Amazon says; a do-it-yourself guide to object-oriented programming using ANSI-C with detailed examples and a preprocessor (written in awk) to simplify coding.

Seems like the book is now free and it can be downloaded as a [PDF](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ats/books/ooc.pdf).

The book originally came with a floppy disk containing source code, this code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/shichao-an/ooc).
